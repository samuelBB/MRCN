# MRCN 

## Graph-Theoretic Algorithms and Tools for the MRCN Problem

The maximum rectilinear crossing number (MRCN) problem asks to maximize the number of edge crossings in rectilinear plane embeddings of arbitrary graphs. This project includes various approximation algorithms for the MRCN problem, as well as an exact superpolynomial-time algorithm for the case where embeddings are restricted to be convex. Functions to faciliate testing these algorithms are included, as well as functionality to plot graphs and compute standard graph-theoretic properties.

**Note** This project would probably see an increase in efficiency if converted (at least partially) to `numpy` computation.

## Installation and Usage

This project is compatible with both Python 2.x and 3.x. After cloning, running `pip install -r requirements.txt` should be all you need.

Run `example_usage.ipynb` with `jupyter` for a brief tutorial. Refer to code docstrings/comments for more advanced usage.
